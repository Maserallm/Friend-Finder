Welcome to LIRI. This is a Language Interpreatation and Recognition Interface that listens for commands written in the command line interface in node. With this CLI, you can search spotify for your favorite songs; it will pull up information about these songs like the album the song was on, the artist that are on there, and even a link to preview the song.

You can also search to see what artists and bands are playing around the world; and you can find fun facts about your favorite movies.
